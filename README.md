## Overview
_Overview gotten from https://www.service.mattel.com/._ UNO FLIP™ plays like regular UNO®, except there are two sides to the deck of cards: a “light” side and a “dark” side. You start playing with the Light Side, but whenever someone plays a FLIP card, the deck is flipped over (as are the cards in your hand) and now everyone must play off of the Dark Side of the cards. Players must play with the Dark Side cards until someone else plays another FLIP card, and then play goes back to the Light Side, and so on until someone has played all the cards in their hand, ending the round. **DISCLAIMER: This is a spin-off version!**
